                <img id="bio-image" src="Jesus.png" alt="Jesus Manteca">
                <p>Born in Guadalajara, the heart of Mexico, Jesus moved to the United States when he was only ten years old. 
                    Although the move was tough, facing a new country, new language, new people, and new climate, it prepared him for many more changes to come.
                    Besides High School, he never attended a school longer than two years and after he graduated, he went to Marquette University to study communications.
                    After two years, he transferred to DePaul University where he earned a degree in psychology of human development. 
                    <br>
                    After college, he studied health sciences, earning a post baccalaureate certificate and began working as a medical assistant in busy private practice.
                    Several years later, he became the managing director of the practice but found he was missing something and made a drastic career change into advertising. 
                    <br>
                    He began his new career as a Planner and Strategist with a reputable ad agency, Elemento L2 and subsequently went to client side working with V&V Supremo, an award-winning Hispanic Midwestern Cheese company. 
                    After growing the social media accounts for V&V Supremo, he began to work with DDB in Chicago on national accounts like Miller Lite and ConAgra, among others and became a community manager for the renowned agency.
                    <br> 
                    Two years later, he put his career on hold and he and his wife set off to travel, first to the Pacific Northwest, followed by the Southwest in Arizona. There he began to take courses to pursue his dream of becoming a web developer in order to help his ideas take off the ground.
